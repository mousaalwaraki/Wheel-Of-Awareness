## Summary
Using AVAudioPlayer I was able to create a meditation app, that follows the wheel of awareness guided meditation by Dan Siegel.  
Using an array of sound files users are able to create their own custom guided meditation, by choosing how long they'd want to do certain parts of the meditation practice.
Due to not owning the content and not having permission to use it I have been unable to submit it to the App Store.  
Therefore I have not completed all the features I would like, or implemented the UI design I wanted.  

## Challenges
As the first I created I ran into plenty of beginner challenges, however the most noteable challenge was allowing the user creating a custom wheel.  
Initially as I had no experience with AVAudioPlayer, I was unable to play files when one ends and so I had created an if function that would loop around  
silent time to create custom durations. As I got more experienced, I changed that by cutting audio files of the practice including a 'silent' audio file,  
I then create an array of the audio files using the users' choice.
