# Wheel-Of-Awareness

Using AVAudioPlayer I was able to create a meditation app, that follows the wheel of awareness guided meditation by Dan Siegel. 
Using an array of sound files users are able to create their own custom guided meditation. 
Due to not owning the content and not having permission to use it I have been unable to submit it to the App Store. 
Therefore not completed all the features I would like.
