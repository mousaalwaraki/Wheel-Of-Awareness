Intestines \n         a. starting with the bottom of the intestines \n         b. moving up slowly to where the stomach is  \n         c. then following the osoephogus the tube that connects the stomach and mouth \n         d.

Many things may arise or nothing may arise; whatever happens is fine. \n \n Second part: Again, invite anything into awareness, but this time pay special attention to the way mental activities first arise, stay present, and then leave awareness. If a mental activity is not immediately replaced by another activity, what does the gap feel like before a new one arises?"

Begin that practice now... \n \n Finding the breath again and riding its wave, in and out . . . .

Combining our inner Me with our interconnected We, we continue with statements of kind intention for MWe: \n \n May MWe . . . be happy and live with meaning, connection, and equanimity, and a playful, grateful, and joyful heart. \n May MWe . . . be healthy and have a body that gives energy and flexibility, strength and stability. \n May MWe . . . be safe and protected from all sorts of inner and outer harm. \n May MWe . . . flourish and thrive and live with the ease of well-being. \n \n I invite you to once again find the breath and ride the wave of the breath, in and out. . . . And now, letting your eyes come open if they are closed, we’ll bring this Wheel of Awareness practice to a close for now."
