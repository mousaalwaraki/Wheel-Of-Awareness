This is offered by popular request for those familiar with the Wheel to have a more expedited experience available for their busy lives! \n \nIn this 7 minute wheel of awareness practice, the breath becomes a pacer for the movement of the spoke of attention around the rim. \n \nLet the breath be your focus for the first half-minute of silence at the beginning of this recording. \n \nSome people find it helpful when on the third segment of the rim to count the number of breaths by pressing on the fingers of one hand to reach five for each of the first parts of that segment, and to a count of ten for the 'awareness of awareness' portion as well. \n \nWhen this becomes familiar to you, you can use your own timing to experience this consolidated practice without listening to an external voice."

            return "In this 30 minute full-length wheel of awareness practice, the basic elements are included and in addition two expanded reflective elements are added: \n \n1) Awareness of awareness with the bending of the spoke of attention back towards the hub of knowing; \n\n2) During the fourth segment focus on our sense of connectedness, the research-proven statements of positive intentions and kindness are offered to promote self, other and 'MWe' directed compassion."
